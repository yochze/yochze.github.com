		<p>This idea struck me a few weeks ago. Good writers, bloggers, coders and other contributers should not pay for their own coffee.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a slidedeck exposing a hint of the idea:</p>

		<p>Connecting remote servers using SSH is a fundamental part of my daily tasks. Whether it&#8217;s connecting to a EC2 instance or managing the VPS of a certain app, it is all taken care of through the SSH protocol.</p>

<p>The SSH protocol allows your to login and connect to a remote server and execute commands on that server.</p>

<p>Normally, I have used the following to connect a remote server</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh -i ~/cert.pem ec2-user@ec2-123-123-123.amazonaws.com</code></pre>

<p>This is terribly long, and in case you have several servers to manage - it is also very confusing. So I was looking a way to make it easier and simpler.</p>

<p>I have found that adding my servers to a <code>config</code> file in the <code>.ssh</code> directory might do the trick. Here is what I have done:</p>

<pre><code>$ touch ~/.ssh/config # 
$ vim ~/.ssh/config</code></pre>

<p>Inside the config file, I added the info mentioned below. The info represents a single connection to a remote server. It requires an alias, the server address, the username and the location of the ssl certificate.</p>

<pre><code>Host: webbing
HostName: ec2-user@ec2-123-123-123.amazonaws.com 
User: ec2-user
IdentifyFile: ~/cert.pem</code></pre>

<p>Now, the <code>connecting</code> command has shortned to</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh webbing</code></pre>

		<p>As part of my job, I had a task that involved handling huge TSV datasets (of 1b records). My specific task was to parse all of the datasets and form a new combined one.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it will take days until completed, this parsing task sound easy to handle. However, the main difficulty I was facing - was that I had to run the process on another server through my own computer with an internet line that was occasionally interrupted.</p>

<p>So after a few failed attempts of running this through my local machine, I started searching for a solution that will allow me to run a script on a remote unix server without having to stay connected (to server) throughout the entire process.</p>

<h1 id='and_then_there_was_nohup'>And then there was nohup</h1>

<p>nohup is a unix utility that enables you to run a command and keep it running even though session is disconnected or user has logged out.</p>

<pre><code>$ nohup ./parser.sh &amp;</code></pre>

<p>This simple command saved my computer from working days and nights continuously. This utility, <code>&quot;no hang up&quot;</code>, runs a command while staying immune to hangup signals such user logging out etc.</p>

<p>Besides running the script without interruptions, it also prints the output of the file into <code>$HOME/nohup.out</code>. This can be very useful handling errors or even listening the process&#8217; progress with <code>tailing</code> the log.</p>

		<p>A very detailed, thorough article covering the latest Ruby on Rails vulnerability was posted on DigitalWhisper (Israeli InfoSec Magazine).</p>

<p>In the article, I go through presenting the major vulnerabilities that were exposed within the Rails framwork as a result of failing to safely parse YAML syntax. After identifying the cause of the security hole and explaining the exploits mechanism, I give a few tips on defending against this critical breach.</p>

		<p>Commiting and engaging a personal blog platform was something I always wanted to do. I surely hope that I will have interesting stuff to write about and this platform will be useful and enrichful for people stumbling it.</p>

<p>In the near future I will write about stuff I care about such as: Programming, Design, Open Source.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
